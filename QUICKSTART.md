## Pro Tips 💡

### Tip 1: Start with Big Expenses
Add your largest recurring expenses first (rent, utilities, subscriptions). This gives you the most accurate picture quickly.

### Tip 2: Export Weekly
Make it a habit to export your data every week. Your data is safe in your browser, but backups are even safer!

### Tip 3: Check Insights Daily
The insights panel updates automatically. Check it daily to stay aware of your spending patterns.

### Tip 4: Use Categories Consistently
Always use the same category for similar expenses. This makes the charts and insights more accurate.

### Tip 5: Track Everything
Even small expenses add up! Track your coffee runs, snacks, and small purchases to see the complete picture.

### Tip 6: Set Realistic Goals
Use the recommended monthly savings amount as a guide. If it's too high, adjust your trip target or deadline.

### Tip 7: Review Monthly
At the end of each month, review your charts and insights. Look for patterns and areas to improve.
